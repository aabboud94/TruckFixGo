In addition to roadside repairs, the platform should also support scheduled fleet services that can be booked at a carrier’s yard, distribution center, or driver home base — not just on highways or emergency breakdown locations.

📦 Types of Fleet Services to Support:

Mobile Preventative Maintenance (PM)

Oil changes, filters, belts, coolant checks, DOT pre-trip inspections, etc.

Tire Services

Rotations, replacements, balancing, recap swaps

Trailer and Reefer Maintenance

Reefer checks, dry van seals, light repairs, brake adjustments

In-Yard Diagnostics & Safety Checks

ELD scanners, sensor resets, brake chamber inspections, washer fluid top-off

In-Yard Engine Fault Clears

Quick resets or DPF forced regens via scan tool

Mobile Truck Washing / Detailing

On-site truck and trailer washing at carrier's yard or rest stop

Extra charge if water source isn’t available — configurable in pricing tier

Detailing add-ons: frame degreasing, tire shine, interior detail, tractor polish

🔁 Fleet Service Booking Flow:

Carrier logs in → selects yard or saved address → chooses “Fleet Service” instead of emergency repair

Fleet jobs can be scheduled in advance for specific dates/times

Supports multi-vehicle batch booking (ex: “Wash all 5 trucks Friday 8 AM”)

Mechanic(s) assigned same as roadside, but status uses scheduled start time

Supports recurring services (e.g., “Oil change every 15k miles” or “Wash fleet every 2 weeks”)

💸 Pricing & Water Source Rules

Use dynamic pricing logic:

If carrier provides water hookup: base price applies

If service provider must haul water: surcharge automatically added

Pricing can be set at admin or fleet tier level

Goals

Let drivers or dispatchers create a repair request in under 60 seconds, even on mobile.

Auto-detect current GPS location and show it on a map, with a manual address fallback (for mile markers, exit numbers, etc.).

Show live ETA using the mechanic’s real-time phone location.

Support multiple service types (tire blowouts, fuel delivery, lockouts, coolant, DEF, alternator, brakes, HVAC, etc.).

Enable photo uploads (e.g., damaged tire, roadside position) to help the mechanic prepare.

Let techs share live status (EN_ROUTE, ONSITE, DONE) and message the requester in a chat thread.

Track service history per vehicle (VIN or unit #), so fleets can view previous roadside breakdowns.

Support fleet logins to view active and past requests for multiple trucks.

Dispatcher dashboard shows map of all active jobs + nearby techs for fast assignment.

Seed database for testing: add 1 sample fleet, 1 sample tech, 2 sample service requests, and a dispatcher user.

Add PWA support so the website can be installed on iPhones and Android phones as an app.

Use responsive layouts so truck drivers in the field can use the app on a phone.

Prepare for future features like Stripe payments, SMS alerts, provider bidding, and printable invoices.

Follow scalable backend structure so later features like analytics, SLA tracking, and parts/labor billing are easy to add.

Store all timestamps in UTC; show them based on the user's browser timezone.

Use modern trucking UX: big tap targets, real-time maps, status colors (green, yellow, red), and safety-forward UI.

Keep code modular: easy to extract and wrap into a fully native mobile app (React Native or Capacitor) later for background GPS.

Document all current and future status states in README (e.g., NEW, ASSIGNED, EN_ROUTE, ONSITE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED).

Include error and offline states—e.g., if tech doesn’t move or goes offline, show “Last seen 12m ago.”

Add placeholder for ratings & reviews (ex: 5-star + comments after completion).

Show parts & labor subtotal inputs for tech to capture costs at the end of the job.

Simple company branding: use a primary color (e.g., fleet blue or safety orange) and logo placeholder area.
